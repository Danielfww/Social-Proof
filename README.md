## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size


### Links

- Live Site URL: https://codepen.io/danielfww/live/KKLNqrr

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid and Flex
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This project took me a bit of time, I struggled with order of things - when I had desktop version done, I didnt really added the div container and had to redo the whole structure.
Whem I added the div, there is extra space on the bottom of the page that I dont know how to remove - any help would be much appreaciated.

### Continued development

- The next project I do will be with Java script and Im hoping that I will finish that one in less time.
